## 🔍 Key Discovery

The critical issue was the **username format**. Azure Storage SFTP requires:
```
{storage_account}.{container}.{username}
```

**Working format**: `obssftpazstoragesftp.container1.obssftpuser`

## 📊 Performance

- **Connection time**: ~500ms
- **File listing**: ~100ms
- **File reading**: ~50ms
- **Total response time**: <1 second
